## Description

Bookipedia is a search engine for books -- brining together data from multiple sources to allow you to browse and learn about your favorite books and authors all in one place. It will provide you with information about the book, links to learn more about the author, and more. Once you've found what you're looking for through search, you can favorite the books that you like and save them to re-visit in the future!

## Usage

To use this application, navigate to [Bookipedia](https://obelisk477.github.io/bookipedia/). Using the search bar in the top left, you can search for any book title you like, and it will give you results related to your search.

In the the search results below, you can see more information about each of the relevant books listed. For each book, you can get more information about the author or publisher by navigating to their dynamically generated wikipedia page right beside the book title. If this is a book you want to reference in the future, clicking on the book icon to the right will add it to your favorites list.

If you'd like to view your favorite saved books, simply  click on the 'Favorites' link on the top right of the page. This will take you to a history of books that you've saved. And if you want to remove them from your favorites, you can do so there as well by clicking on the remove icon.
